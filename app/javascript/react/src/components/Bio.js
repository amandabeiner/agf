              I am a historian of the twentieth-century United States. My research and teaching unite black feminist analysis and critical race studies to explore histories of gender, sexuality, and race; law enforcement and the state; and social and political movements in the modern United States.

              I am currently completing my PhD in History at Brown University with a Certificate in Gender and Sexuality Studies. My work is supported by a Mellon/ACLS Dissertation Completion Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies and a Dissertation Fellowship in Womenâ€™s Studies from the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. Articles adapted from my dissertation are forthcoming in the <i>Journal of American History</i> and "Social Histories of Neoliberalism," a special issue of the <i>Journal of Social History</i>. I have published op-eds, review essays, and interviews in the <i>Washington Post, Boston Globe, Bitch,</i> and elsewhere.

          My project, “Arrestable Behavior: Women, Police Power, and the Making of Law-and-Order America,” delivers the twentieth-century history of an often overlooked fixture of the contemporary criminal system: today, proportionally more black women are arrested for morals violations than any other group. At the beginning of this history, in the 1930s, more than one-third of all women arrested in the United States were charged with morals misdemeanors, including disorderly conduct, vagrancy, and prostitution. White women accounted for as much as seventy percent of these arrests. By the 1980s, however, these statistics had become inverted. Morals offenses accounted for just ten percent of all women’s arrests, but black women were the majority of women charged. In this work, I ask: why, as women overall became a shrinking target of sexual policing in a period of sexual liberalization, were black women increasingly subject to a mounting program of racially charged morals law enforcement?

          Throughout this period, police officers were empowered with tremendous discretion to determine which woman they observed walking, talking, and socializing on city streets was a sexual offender. A police officer did not have to witness any particular act to make an arrest. The only evidence typically required to convict women of these morals misdemeanors was police testimony based on a subjective term of art: an observed woman’s “arrestable behavior.” That shorthand constituted a vague metric of sexual criminality drawn from the officer’s appraisal of a woman’s racial and class appearance, reputation, the company she allegedly kept, and the neighborhood in which she was apprehended. As a result, all sorts of women’s sexual and social choices—or circumstances—were gathered under the legal category of women’s sexual crime. The uniquely discretionary, police-driven enforcement of morals laws vividly demonstrates how upheavals in racial and sexual politics across the twentieth century remade white and black women as policed subjects.

          I argue that between the 1930s and the 1980s, the racial function of women’s sexual criminalization changed: from the moral restoration of white womanhood to the disciplinary policing of black womanhood. This shift from white women’s rehabilitation to black women’s punishment was a powerful yet understudied driver of law-and-order policing, which is associated primarily with the targeting of black men in the War on Drugs. Ultimately, as white women’s nonmarital heterosexual practices were gradually decriminalized in the postwar decades, the sexual policing of black women transitioned from a marginal corner of law enforcement into an aggressive, everyday feature of contemporary urban police departments beholden to anxious city mayors and white voters. “Arrestable Behavior” narrates the changing racial and gendered meanings of sexual criminality through an analysis of legal reforms; institutional changes in police departments; and political contests among policewomen, police leaders, rank-and-file officers, feminists, and black city residents. To do this work, I draw on newly discovered and little-used police, probation, and prison records in over twenty state and private archives, and I apply interdisciplinary insights from black feminist analysis and critical race and legal studies. By illuminating both the racial dimension of sexual liberalism and the gender dimension of policing in black neighborhoods, “Arrestable Behavior” illustrates the decisive role that race, gender, and sexuality played in the construction of modern U.S. legal regimes.
